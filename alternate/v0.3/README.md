```css
piOS Discord Theme Update
/* version 0.3, February 5th */
#Added    square corners on everything
#Added    fancy spoiler overlay for images and text
#Added    custom scrollbar on message area
#Improved support for use with other themes
#Improved contrast between enabled and disabled emojis
#Fixed    unstyled grey backgrounds
#Removed  glow in message area for readability
#Removed  Herobrine
```

So, removing glow from the piOS theme has been somewhat unpopular. Here's an optional patch to re-enable glow in the main message panel.

For the next version of the theme (0.4, probably), the glow is returning with option to toggle in the Themes menu.
